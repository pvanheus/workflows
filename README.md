[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/common-workflow-language/workflows.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/common-workflow-language/workflows)


"CWL Tools & Workflows" is the community's best practices for CWL tool and
workflow descriptions. 

To submit a new workflow or tool description please make a pull request against
this repository.

Any contribution submitted for inclusion in this repository shall be under the

## Pull request

Please follow these recommendations before pull request:

* One file per tool or per logical part of the tool (those with subcommands)
* CWL tool description filename should have the same name as the tool (Tool’s
  name *STAR* CWL tool description filename ```STAR.cwl```) if possible (no
  conflicts with existing files) and placed into *tools* directory
* If a tool has subcommands, like
  [samtools](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html) or
  [bwa](https://github.com/lh3/bwa/blob/master/README.md), use tool’s name dash
  subcommand name. For example, ```bwa-mem.cwl``` or ```samtools-index.cwl```
* Each CWL tool description should be provided with job and test files and
  placed into the *test* directory
 * Job’s filename has to be suffixed CWL file basename plus *-job.json*
   (bwa-mem-job.json, samtools-index-job.json)
 * Test’s filename has to be suffixed CWL file basename plus *-test.yaml*
   (bwa-mem-test.yaml, samtools-index-test.yaml)
* Use docker for the tool your are describing
 * If the tool has subcommands and you are going to use the same Docker image,
   move the DockerRequirement class into separate file
   (```samtools-docker.yml```) and *$import* it
 * If you are a maintainer of the Docker image, it is good to provide content
   of the Dockerfile in class DockerRequirement (dockerFile)

Incomplete descriptions are welcome as long as they are usable. Sharing early &
often is encouraged.

## SPARQL

For your convinience an
[Apache Jena Fuseki](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2/) SPARQL
server is provided. It automaticaly downloads new CWL tool descriptions
converts them into XML/RDF format and makes available at
https://sparql-test.commonwl.org or https://sparql-cwl.cloudapp.net/ . Each CWL
tool becomes a graph that can be queried. 
Provided sample queries all the graphs where foaf:name **"Dobin"** is present. 

To run a simple query that searches for all graphs(cwl files) where foaf:name is "Dobin":
```SPARQL
    PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>
    PREFIX doap: <http://usefulinc.com/ns/doap#>
        SELECT distinct ?file ?name
    WHERE {
      graph ?file {
      ?P foaf:name ?name  .
      FILTER (regex(?name, "Dobin","i"))
      }
    }
    LIMIT 25
```

If you use different ontologies like schema and foaf you can join them in one query using union: 
```SPARQL
    PREFIX schema: <http://schema.org/>
    PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>
    PREFIX adms: <http://www.w3.org/ns/adms#>    
    SELECT ?file ?name 
    WHERE {
      graph ?file {
      {
       ?P a foaf:Person;
            foaf:name ?name.
       ?x adms:includedAsset ?SSC .
       ?SSC !schema:Thing+ ?P .
       FILTER (regex(?name, "Dobin","i"))
       }
     union {
       ?P a schema:Person;
            schema:name ?name.
       ?SSC a schema:SoftwareSourceCode .
       ?file ?direct ?SSC .
       ?SSC !schema:Thing+ ?P .
       FILTER (regex(?name, "Karimi","i"))
       }
      }
    }
```

If you provide DOI url and use it as id for a class, it will be automaticaly pulled into default graph. You can query DOI information to find corresponding CWL:
```SPARQL
    PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>
	PREFIX schema: <http://schema.org/>
    SELECT distinct ?file ?DOI ?name
    WHERE {
       ?DOI ?direct0 ?P .
       ?P foaf:name ?name  .    
       FILTER (regex(?name, "Lorincz","i"))
    GRAPH ?file {
        ?SSC a schema:SoftwareSourceCode .
        ?file ?direct1 ?SSC .
        ?SSC !schema:Thing+ ?DOI .
        } 
    }
```

Another one:
```SPARQL
    PREFIX schema: <http://schema.org/>
    PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>
    select distinct ?file ?name
    where {
    ?pub !schema:Thing+ ?Person .
    ?Person foaf:name ?name .
    graph ?file {
        ?SSC schema:publication ?pub .
     } 
    }
```


## Testing CWLs

Test directory includes:
* dm3_chr4.fa - Chromosome 4 of Drosophila genome
* dm3_chr4.gtf - Chromosome 4 RefSeq annotation file
* SRR1031972.fastq - The reduced raw reads file ( reads from Chromosome 4 only, RNA-Seq data)

To test tools run ```test/test.sh``` from the repository root.
